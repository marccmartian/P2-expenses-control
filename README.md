# Expenses-control 💵💰

This projest was created with `vite` 👨‍💻

This is a small test website for control expenses, made with react, where I used concepts like forms, props, component communication, useState, useEffect, localStorage and some UI libraries like circular progress bar and swipeable list 🤓🤙
